        <h1>How the World Could End</h1>

        <h2>Scenarios that spell the end of life as we know</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Right now, you're probably feeling pretty good. After all, life inthe developed world is comfortable —probably
        more comfortable than it's been for the average human being throughout all of recorded history.</p>

    <figure class="figure">
        <img src="img/human_skull.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="figcaption">Will you be the last person standing if one of these apocalyptic scenarios plays
            out?
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article, you'll
        learn about a few of our favorites.</p>

    <h3>Mayan Doomsday</h3>

    <p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually
        predict a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything
        else,why should we trust them on this?</p>
